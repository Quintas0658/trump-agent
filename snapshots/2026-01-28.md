As a former Appointee in my Administration at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and, as the youngest State Legislator in Iowa’s History, Joe has proven he has the Courage and Wisdom to deliver strong results for the incredible people of his wonderful State and Nation. As your next Congressman, Joe will fight tirelessly to Grow our E

**[2026-01-28 00:46]** It is my Great Honor to endorse MAGA Warrior and Fountain County GOP Chair, Paula Copenhaver, a terrific Candidate for Indiana's 23rd State Senate District (which I won by 26 points!).

Deery and his RINO friends made Indiana, a State I love and have been very good to, the only State in the Country that essentially sai

**[2026-01-28 00:53]** It is my Great Honor to endorse America First Patriot, Jeff Ellington, a terrific Candidate for Indiana's 39th State Senate District (which I won by a whopping 55 points!). Jeff will be a fantastic replacement for RINO Eric Bassler, who may not even run again because Republicans are so angry with him over his betrayal he committed when he, for whatever reason, voted against Redistricting in Indiana, which essentially made him a partner to the Radical Left Democrats in their quest to take control

**[2026-01-28 00:58]** It is my Great Honor to endorse MAGA Warrior, Michael Alfonso, a young “STAR” who is running to represent the incredible people of Wisconsin’s 7th Congressional District. Michael is the son-in-law of our GREAT Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, and the wonderful Rachel Campos-Duffy, of FoxNews, one of the most popular (and talented!) anchors in all of Television. His family has been fierce advocates for our Movement to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! As your next Congressman, Michael will work

**[2026-01-28 12:26]** It is the same mindset that gave pro football the new and unwatchable “Sissy” Kickoff Rule, that made it possible for Bill Belichick to not be elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Both are ridiculous and should be overturned!

**[2026-01-28 13:23]** Surprisingly, Mayor Jacob Frey just stated that, “Minneapolis does not, and will not, enforce Federal Immigration Laws.” This is after having had a very good conversation with him. Could somebody in his inner sanctum please explain that this statement is a very serious violation of the Law, and that he is PLAYING WITH FIRE!
